##AdGate Rewards Android SDK by AdGate Media
### Introduction
Thank you for choosing AdGate Media to monetize your Android app! We look forward to working with you and your users in a way that is beneficial to everyone involved. If you haven't done so already, please sign up for an affiliate account at http://www.adgatemedia.com.

Our SDK will allow you to easily present an offer wall in your native Android app. To display it, please follow these 3 steps:

1. [Install the SDK](#1-install-sdk)
2. [Display offer wall to user](#2-display-the-offer-wall)
3. [Check our Demo app for an example](#3-demo-app)

###Requirements

The following are the minimum requirements for using our SDK

- Android SDK minimum version 9 (Gingerbread 2.3.6)
- Minimum hardware requirement is ARMV7
- Java JDK 1.6 or greater
- The following permission added to your manifest:

``` xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>

```

###1. Install SDK

> Instructions provided here are for Android Studio. aar libraries are not yet supported on
> Eclipse, though some solutions are available online.

1. Download the aar file from the downloads directory
2. Add the aar file to your project, by copying it into your projectâ€™s libs folder.

3. Add the following lines of code to your app's `build.gradle` file, so that Android Studio 
recognizes and builds the library along with your app.

``` xml
repositories {
    flatDir {
        dirs 'libs'
    }
}

dependencies {
    compile(name:'adgatemediasdk', ext:'aar')
}

```
At this point Android Studio shouldn't throw any errors related to the library.

###2. Display the offer wall

1. In your activity, where you intend to show the offer wall, add the following import statement:

```java

import com.adgatemedia.sdk.classes.AdGateMedia;

```

2. To show the offer wall, from any place in your activity add the following code:

```java
   final HashMap<String, String> subids = new HashMap<String, String>();
   subids.put("s2", "my sub id");

   AdGateMedia adGateMedia = new AdGateMedia(wallCode,userName);
   adGateMedia.showOfferWall(subids, YourActivity.this);

```

Remember to set `wallCode` and `userName` to the appropriate values. You can get your AdGate Rewards wall code from the [Dashboard](https://panel.adgatemedia.com/affiliate/vc-walls). The `userName` values can be any alphanumeric string. You may add up to 4 subid strings to the HashMap: s2, s3, s4, and s5.

###3. Demo app
